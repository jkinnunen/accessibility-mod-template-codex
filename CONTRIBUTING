# Contributing to Accessibility Mod Template (Codex)

## About this project

This repository is a foundation for starting accessibility modding projects with OpenAI Codex.

It was created from the perspective of a blind screen reader user. The goal is to help new modders get started with:
- A strong technical baseline
- Repeatable accessibility patterns
- Protection against common pitfalls
- Clear guidance that Codex can follow

## How you can help

If you've used this template or built an accessibility mod:
- What did you find useful?
- What was missing or confusing?
- What additional templates or documentation would help?
- What prompts or instruction patterns helped Codex produce better code?

### 2. Technical feedback (especially from experienced programmers)

Honest feedback is welcome:
- Where does it show this was created without traditional coding knowledge?
- Which coding patterns should be improved?
- Which architectural decisions need reconsidering?
- Which common mistakes should the template help avoid?
- Are the provided code templates following best practices?

### 3. Additional templates
