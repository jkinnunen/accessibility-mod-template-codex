# Codex project configuration
# Loaded only when the project is marked "trusted" in your Codex client.
#
# This repository is designed for Codex CLI primarily.
#
# Profiles are experimental and may change or be removed in future releases.
# They are not currently supported in the Codex IDE extension.
#
# Select a profile when starting Codex:
#   codex --profile default
#   codex --profile research
#   codex --profile deps
#   codex --profile yolo
#
# You can also override any setting for a single run:
#   codex --config sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true
#   codex --config model='"gpt-5.2-codex"'
#
# For a fuller workflow guide, see: docs/codex-workflow.md

# Default profile loaded unless overridden by `codex --profile <name>`.
profile = "default"

# Keep top-level values minimal; profiles carry the real settings.

# Use only for temporary, supervised runs where you intentionally want zero approvals.
# This profile can modify arbitrary files and run commands with full access.
